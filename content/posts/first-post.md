this is the first ever post 

How completely had Rome now lost the greatness which she once
possessed! patriotism had faded from the empire; the spirit of
liberty had expired.  

If republican forms remained, the life which
had once animated them was gone, and they were made the covering for
despotic practices, and oriental courtiership.  Laws no longer
depended on the decrees of the senate, but on the rescripts of
emperors, and government sank into a fearful despotism,--the
punishment, under Divine Providence, of states unfaithful to liberty.

It has been often observed, that despotism was the only kind of rule
which could hold the Roman empire together during the last age of its
history: but what a striking proof does that fact present of the
thoroughly corrupt state of Roman civilisation!

## Math

You can use LaTeX math in your posts. For inline math, use single dollar signs, e.g. $E = mc^2$.

For display math, use double dollar signs:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

You can also use environments like align:

$$
\begin{align}
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
\end{align}
$$

Here is a very long LaTeX equation to test horizontal scrolling and container overflow:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} dx = 1 \quad \text{where} \quad \mu \text{ is the mean and } \sigma^2 \text{ is the variance of the normal distribution function, and this equation is intentionally long to test the rendering and scrolling behavior of MathJax in Hugo posts.}
